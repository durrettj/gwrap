# gwrap
Simple grep Wrapper Script

This is a simple script that puts grep through a loop allowing you to search for terms or phrases without having to type the entire search command again. It is very useful when you are not quite sure what you are looking for and need to search for multiple phrases.

Usage: grwap.sh [file or directory to search]

It only runs grep -r. For more complex options, just change the grep command in the script!

The main purpose is to save on keystrokes and time.
